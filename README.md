# UnrealArtProject
Here you will find snipits of the Unreal Art Project I worked on with my Professor, Amir Yatziv and colleague, Lucy Hass. 

The idea behind the project was to create a continuous art exhibit that mimicked an archeological site documentry. The viewer would enter the room and watch as an archeologist slowly discovered a story from a civilation that exhisted hundreds of years ago. As the viewer continued to listen they would slowly discover that the story being discovered is actually a story taken from the top 10 news articals in the paper at that exact moment. The discoveries made by the archeologist mirrored today's reality, putting everything in perspective.

This project used ChatGPT, TextToSpeech, Image Generators, and Unreal Engine to build the stories. The project was stopped and never continued at the start of the war but I learned so much from the process.

Here you can find parts of the Unreal Blueprint code, Python code to extract information from the JSON file, and an example of the JSON file
