Here you will find snipits of the Unreal Art Project I worked on with my Professor, Amir Yatziv and colleague, Lucy Hass. 

The idea behind the project was to create a continuous art exhibit that mimicked an archeological site documentary. The viewer would enter the room and watch as an archeologist slowly discovered a story from a civilation that existed hundreds of years ago. As the viewer continued to listen they would slowly discover that the story being unveiled is actually a story taken from the top 10 news articals in the paper at that exact moment. The discoveries made by the archeologist mirrored todays reality, putting everything in perspective.

This project used ChatGPT, Azure TextToSpeech, Image Generators, and Unreal Engine to build the stories. The project was discontinued at the start of the war but I learned so much from the process.

Here you can find parts of the Unreal Blueprint code, Python code to extract information from the JSON file, and an example of the JSON file.
